Types of data science tasks that we could encounter:
1. Churn prediction
2. Sales forecasting
3. Sentiment analysis
4. Image classification
5. Object detection

diff types of data that we encounter
1. Structured: CSV, .txt, .xls, sql style databases
pandas - that allows to read/update/delet structured data and create DS workflows
numpy  - ability to transform and apply diff math functions

2. Unstructured: Image, audio and text based data
Image classification, Object detection, pitch classification and other natural language use cases
images - opencv, Pillow
audio  - scipy --> spectrograms
text   - nltk, huggingface tranformers


Analyze and Visualize data:


Before the model is built, the dataset is split into training and testing. The model is built with the training data, and the model is evaluated with the test data. You can use the train_test_split method in scikit-learn to split the dataset into training and testing. With this method, you can easily split the dataset.

Linear regression: a linear approximation of a causal relationship vitween 2 or more variables.
In Linear regression we are minimizing mean squared error.
y = mx + b find best fit m and b values
